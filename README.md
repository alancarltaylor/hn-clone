## Hacker News Clone

Here is a pretty crumby skeleton of a Hacker News Clone react application. Let's make it better. Feel free to refactor as you go or write any additional tests.

Spend no more than 2 hours making the tests pass and adding additional functionality.

### Make Tests Pass

1. Render a card for each Hack News article returned from the API. Let's show at least the article's title and author.
1. Search should be working! Enter a search term, and then hit the button to get the updated results from the API.

### Dive In

How can we make the app more interesting? What sparks your interest?

1. Error handling
1. Refactor the code to make it cleaner
1. Snazzy CSS Styling
1. Additional API Functionality [Hacker News API Docs](https://hn.algolia.com/api)
1. Pagination

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies `npm install`
1. Start the App `npm start`
1. Run the tests `npm test`
